<h3>Instruction</h3>
Please pull the whole file. We wrote the script for both MySQL and MongoDB, you just need to copy it and paste to the shell. <br>
Move folder "Dazala" to xampp and run localhost. Our website starts from file "index.html".
For MongoDB, we have file dazala.json for you to import database into your local machine with MongoDBCompass. You must name the database "dazala" and then create a collection name "dazala" so that it works for the whole system.
